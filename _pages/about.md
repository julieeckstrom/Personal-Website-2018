	<p>Julie is a design researcher, interaction, experience, information, and service designer. At the moment, she's working at Bossa Nova Robotics in Pittsburgh, PA. Julie is a strong believer in using design thinking to create positive change when many perspectives are involved. She is interested how design thinking can help make technology fields more accessible to those who may be intimidated by traditional information structures or masculine language and design.</p>

	<p>Julie is approaching robotics holistically by creating an entire human experience around a robot, from the virtual experience of the software engineers who operate and monitor the robots to the physical experience of passersby to the robot.</p>

	<p>Julie previously worked in eCommerce, where she designed mobile experiences for Fortune 500 companies. She was the lead designer for the Dick's Sporting Goods mobile properties where she launched the eCommerce experience for CALIA by Carrie Underwood.</p>
