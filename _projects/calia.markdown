# Challenege

CALIA by Carrie Underwood is a Dick's Sporting Goods women's athleisure brand. We were challeneged with creating an eCommerce website for the new product line that would serve as a place to showcase a lifestyle and allow for growth as new product lines launched in the upcoming seasons.

# The Result

The CALIA website went live with the announcement of the brand launch, getting tens of thousands of visitors a day. It still serves as the face of the eCommerce presence.

# Process

The website request came in a month before the product launch, so there was little time for a lot of work. An initial brief information gathering process revealed a look and feel that could work with the minimal  product line. An exploration of other eCommerce sites with similar feels presented options to stakeholders. Mockups  went through a sign-off process with the internal Dick's marketing department and with Carrie Underwood's personal team. The site was developed and tested just in time for the product launch mid-March 2015.

# My Role

There was limited context that came with the request for the site, so I worked with merchanizers, product and project managers, and marketing to gather the branding and product requirements. I gathered inspiration websites that had similar feels to the brand. I created wireframes and mockups that were presented to all teams within the eCommerce department and the marketing department for sign-off. I collaborated with a production designer to create the final mockups, and make sure the mockups we created would scale well responsively. I then worked with the developers to make sure they had the specs they needed, following up when development work was completed to ensure usability.
