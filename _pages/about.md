I am a Designer (interaction, user experience, service, whatever title you want to place on it) currently working at Bossa Nova Robotics, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I believe in designing the right thing within given and found contraints. I work in the entire design process, from ethnographic and user research, to strategy and information architecture, interaction design, visual design, and iterative testing along the way. Organizing qualitative and quantitative information runs in my blood. I believe insight is best discovered once our concepts and information are organized in a way that makes them shine through. 

I'm currently working at Bossa Nova Robotics, where I'm designing a human-robot interaction experience. I also design internal applications needed to operate and solve problems, and the initial and continued service of introducing a robot into a retail store. I'm also heavily involved in defining the direction of our brand and cultural identity. My latest passion is findings ways that my and my team's virtual and physical designs can help demystify robotics sciences to lower the bar of entry.

I have previously worked at Dick's Sporting Goods as the lead mobile UX designer, and before that I was at Branding Brand, where I worked with brands such as Ralph Lauren, Sephora, Costco, and American Eagle.
