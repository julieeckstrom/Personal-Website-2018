# Challenge

Create a system that directs people's attention to robots in needs, and provides them to right information to fix a problem.

# The Result

Atlas is an ongoing project, and will be revealed in 2017!  

# Process

Part of my work with robotics is also designing a system that tells engineers and operators everything they need to know about the robots. Before I came on, our engineers had created an interface that let an operator control a robot while physically co-located with the robot. 

# My Role

I'm the lead on the HRI project at Bossa Nova. All of the work described above is my own, along with a close collaboration with my design director.
