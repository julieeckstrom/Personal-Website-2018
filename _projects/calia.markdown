## Challenege

CALIA by Carrie Underwood is a Dick's Sporting Goods women's athleisure brand. We were challenged with creating an eCommerce experience for the new product line that would launch a month away.

## Process

CALIA by Carrie Underwood is an athletic clothing line designed by women for women. Many athletic brands come with a masculine, aggressive voice, which can be intimidating to women who are wanting to improve their lives by becoming more active. CALIA is intended to fit women's needs with a feminine voice. 

CALIA is owned by Dick's Sporting Goods, but has a very different brand from its parent. Before launch, it needed its own responsive website to represent this brand. I found an online aesthetic that would fit the CALIA brand identity. The clothing line was limited, so a complicated navigational structure wasn't necessary. I did a brief exploration of eCommerce sites that have a similar simple aesthetic, and showed a few different options to stakeholders. I created wireframes, and collaborated with a production designer to create mockups that were vetted through the internal Dick's Sporting Goods marketing department as well as Carrie Underwood's personal brand team. There wasn't much time before the launch, so I had to quickly get designs to developers before the launch a month away. 

CALIA launched mid-March 2015, and the website immediately had tens of thousands of visitors a day.
