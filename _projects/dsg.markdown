## Challenge

The Dick's Sporting Goods mobile and tablet sites needed some updating when I started. While at Dick's, I took the existing mobile and tablet sites and updated the look of them. My goal for each one of the pages was to remove the visual clutter, construct a clear hierarchy, make everything appropriately sized for a mobile screen, and overall visual refinement. I was working within the existing style framework already established by the desktop site, and there were many instances where I had to make tradeoffs between usability and brand identity.

My process for prototyping, designing, and communicating these changes was unusual due to the difficulty of making changes to an old code base. Something may not be possible given how the overall site is structured. Because of this, I would prototype using HTML/CSS on the existing site, and communicate changes with developers using my own code.

Other projects on Dick's Sporting Goods eCommerce included design strategy for the iOS app, quantitative testing on all channels of eCommerce including in-store kiosks, and qualitative testing of new features for the mobile and tablet sites.
