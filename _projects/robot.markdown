# Challenge

Create a positive interaction between a robot and people within a retail environment.

# The Result

Atlas is an ongoing project, and will be revealed in 2017!  

# Process

## Constraints

The contraints on this project are interesting. The robot is human-sized, which means that it needs to follow some of the rules of human-human interaction. It can more easily be percieved as rude if it crosses the an affordance space (the space between a shopper and the shelf they're looking at). 

The people within the robot's environment can make or break the business, so it's a high stakes game to create a positive experience for those around the robot. While I cannot go into details, I can talk about the process we used to get to this positive experience. 

Before Atlas, there was Gaeta+. Gaeta+ was a 5'8" cyclindrical robot that balanced on two wheels. It has bright white skins, and technical looking details all down the back of it. Without the skins it looked like something from a sci-fi movie. We needed to study the human-robot interactions between Gatea+ and shoppers and employees to determine how we needed to design the next experience. We went into 4 different big box retail stores and observed over 200 interactions. Our process of characterizing these interactions went through 4 iterations before we landed on a method that was reliable and provided us the answers to the key questions we were trying to answer. Our studies took us to 4 different stores within the Pittsburgh area and in central USA. 
The data was collected started revealing itself in common themes. We took all of the quotes and all of the quantitative data we had collected and started sorting through it using many sticky notes in an affinity diagram. A persona revealed itself, one that illustrated negative feelings towards the robot. 

We were then able to create a goal persona, against which we'd be able to make design decisions. Also discovered was a framework through which we could implement change for this robot. All decisions could be broken down into three areas of work: communication, behavior, and form. The form touches mechanical engineering and industrial desdign, the behavior touches the firmware and robot software engineers, and the communication aspects are a mixture of electrical, mechanical, and software engineers. 

We spearheaded the communication work by testing ways the robot could communicate key pieces of information to the people around it. We went through 8 rounds of testing various types of communication, and various pieces of communication. 

# My Role

I'm the lead on the HRI project at Bossa Nova. All of the work described above is my own, along with a close collaboration with my design director.
