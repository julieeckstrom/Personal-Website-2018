# My Role

I was the co-design lead on the project. My responsiblities were to create the necessary assets for research, create presentations and images for presentations, do the print design of 100-some page Spring report book, and do the interaction and visual design for the app while still keeping in mind all viewpoints of our team. All of us shared responsibility for conducting research, analyzing results, and presenting our findings.

# Process

## Research

Our research plan consisted of five methods: card sorts, diaries, interviews, ethnographic observations, and surveys. Thanks to the enthusiasm of two hospitals in the Pittsburgh area, we were able to perform card sorts with waiting families. This helped us determine what information was most important to them during their wait. We distributed diaries to families with longer wait times; these diaries kept track of family emotions and questions throughout the day. We handed out surveys that gathered quantitative data on the most common information source for families, their satisfaction with the amount of information, and what type of phone they had. We sat in 11 different waiting rooms to observe how families spent their time while waiting, and we interviewed 8 desk attendants and department heads on current concerns for the waiting room.

## Analysis and Visioning

The second half of the spring semester was spent analyzing the data. We created an affinity diagram of all the data we collected and drew graphs of family emotions throughout the wait. From the data, we pulled out four key findings with which we performed an inital round of visioning to jump-start our summer semester of prototyping.

## Prototyping

After the spring semester, we brainstormed many visions for the mobile application. Our goal was to make it easy for our grandma's to use, as we found great variation in the technology proficiency of people in the waiting room. We narrowed down our ideas and performed concept validation with desk attendants using storyboards.

### Lo-fi

From those ideas, we created paper prototypes that went through two iterations with user testing.

### Mid-fi

Many individuals had difficulty understanding the paper prototypes because of their lo-fidelity, so we quickly moved onto mid-fidelity wireframes. We linked the wireframes using Invision so users could test it on a mobile phone. We performed 3 rounds of user testing while creating new iterations of our mid-fidelity prototype between each test.

### Hi-fi

Using the feedback received from mid-fidelity testing, we moved into our hi-fidelity prototype. I worked on creating hi-fidelity mockups while my teammates built the prototype using Phonegap. We traveled to different hospitals to test our app with users in the waiting room.

# Our Team
Besides myself (co-design lead), our team consisted of Sabrina Li (co-design lead), John Przyborski (project manager), Maya Kreidieh (tech lead), and Nissa Nishiyama (research lead).
