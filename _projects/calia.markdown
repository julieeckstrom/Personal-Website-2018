Carrie Underwood and Dick's Sporting Goods teamed up to create the women's athleisure line, CALIA by Carrie Underwood. Thirty days before product launch in March 2015, my team was asked to create an eCommerce website for the brand.

# My Role

The request to create the eCommerce site arrived on my desk first, so my first step was to create wireframes and direct the look and feel of the site. I ensured that the site maintained simplicity both to meet the tight deadline and because the small product line afforded itself to a simple experience. Then I teamed up with a visual designer to create the mockups needed. A third party was developing the site, so I took on the role of project manager by communicating the design requirements and requests from our marketing team. I collaborated with the marketing team to ensure proper content was on the site, as well as the pre-planned color pallete, typefaces, and Carrie Underwood images. Because I was the only person on the team familiar with responsive web design, I had to coordinate restraints to make sure it was feasible for a responsive design.
