## Challenge

With the health insurance industry as it is today, hospitals rely high results from customer satisfaction surveys to receive portions of their insurance reimbursements. Studies indicated one way to make patients happy is by going through their family members that lived through the experience with them. Teletracking, a healthcare operations company, asked us to create an app to keep family members waiting for loved ones in surgery up-to-date, with the hope of reducing anxiety and increasing ratings.

## The Result

Teletracking Touchpoint resulted. We created an app that guided family members through surgery process, answering their questions along the way. It also helped family members find things to do in the hospital, and suggested pleasant spaces throughout the hospital to wait. Family members can now support each other through giving gifts to the hospital cafeteria and coffee shop, ensuring the patient is not the only one taken care of through the emotional journey of surgery.

## Process

### Research

We wanted to understand the waiting process and thoroughly sympathize with the emotional journey family members go through while waiting for a loved one in surgery. We sat in many waiting rooms to watch people. We interviewed family members to understand their thoughts, and we did card sorting activities to quantify the key information that calmed nerves. We asked waiting room desk attendants to hand out surveys and diaries for families to take and keep, to look at the emotional ups and downs of a long wait that can be seen with open heart surgeries. We analyzed the artifacts that already exist in waiting rooms, and looked at the strong and weak aspects of them.

We also interviewed waiting room desk attendants to understand their days and common questions that family members ask. We asked about the waiting experience, and found that some families are so anxious and desperate for information that they faint from hunger by just waiting.

### Analysis and Visioning

We analyzed all of these experiences we recorded and quantified. We used an affinity diagram of the data to pull out the key themes that we'd focus on, and we created visualizations of the emotional journey. Using these tools and focal points, we began ideating ways that technology can help these family members.

### Prototyping

We pursued a few ideas that could work well within the context of a mobile application. Ultimately, we went through 6 rounds of iteration and user testing to arrive at the final solution. 

## My Role

Besides myself, our team consisted of Sabrina Li, John Przyborski, Maya Kreidieh, and Nissa Nishiyama. 

As a team, we collaborated with determining the research methods we'd use to gather information, analyzing the results of that research, ideating, testing and reviewing designs. I contacted hospitals to get permission to do our research and created the research artifacts. I also created created presentations and designed the 121-page report to present our research findings. I was the interaction and co-visual designer on Touchpoint, where I created wireframes in Balsamiq and mockups in Illustrator.
