# Challenge

Create a positive interaction between a robot and people within a retail environment.

# The Result

Small changes were made to the 

# Process

## Constraints

The contraints on this project are interesting. The robot is human-sized, which means that it needs to follow some of the rules of human-human interaction. It can more easily be percieved as rude if it crosses the an affordance space (the space between a shopper and the shelf they're looking at). 

The people within the robot's environment can make or break the business, so it's a high stakes game to create a positive experience for those around the robot. While I cannot go into details, I can talk about the process we used to get to this positive experience. 

Before Atlas, there was Gaeta+. Gaeta+ was a 5'8" cyclindrical robot that balanced on two wheels. It has bright white skins, and technical looking details all down the back of it. Without the skins it looked like something from a sci-fi movie. We needed to study the human-robot interactions between Gatea+ and shoppers and employees to determine how we needed to design the next experience. We went into 4 different big box retail stores and observed over 200 interactions. Our process of characterizing these interactions went through 4 iterations before we landed on a method that was reliable and provided us the answers to the key questions we were trying to answer. Our studies took us to 4 different stores within the Pittsburgh area and in central USA. 

The data was collected started revealing itself in common themes. To ensure that what we had an inkling were the findings were actually true, we took all of the quotes and all of the quantitative data we had collected and started sorting through it using many sticky notes in an affinity diagram. 

# My Role

As the sole UX designer for the mobile and tablet sites, I suggest what needs to be done, create mockups, and turn them into requirements for third-party developers. Depending on the project, I'll conduct usability studies, card sorts, or tree tests, either with a mockup or a working prototype. My current ongoing project is to increase the legibility of the mobile site. Many of those changes will be launching soon.

In addition to the websites, I'm a key player in defining the experience for a much needed upgrade to the iOS app. At this time, I am unable to share most of the work I've done. However, below are some examples of changes I've implemented. The images on the left are the mobile site's former look, and the images on the right incorporate my changes.
