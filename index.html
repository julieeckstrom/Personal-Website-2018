<p class="deemphasized">Experience Designer</p>
<p>I'm an interaction designer at Bossa Nova Robotics. I like to describe what I do as discovering, organizing, and refining life. I enjoy user research as much as I do getting into the nitty gritty of how something is structured, visually and informationally. I love to create and spread positivity, laughter, and joy through designing experiences in life.</p>
<p>Check out some of my work below, and feel free to get in touch at <a href="mailto:julie.eckstrom@gmail.com">julie.eckstrom@gmail.com</a>.</p>
