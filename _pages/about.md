I am an interaction designer currently working at Bossa Nova Robotics, in Pittsburgh, PA. I strongly believe in designing the right thing, and am involved in the entire design process, from ethnographic and user research, to strategy and information architecture, interaction design, visual design, and iterative testing along the way. My favorite thing to do is organize life. I believe insight is best discovered once our concepts and information are organized in a way that makes them shine through. 

Finally breaking out of school, I've been discovering the outdoors through hiking, biking, and backpacking. I've also been discovering ways in which the design philosphy is applied to other areas of life, such as developement work or even neighborhood relations. 

I'm currently working at Bossa Nova Robotics, where I take the lead on defining the human-robot interaction experience. I also design internal applications needed to solve problems, and present our found data in ways that help our engineers solve problems. As the company is a start up, I'm also heavily involved in defining the direction of our culture.

I have previously worked at Dick's Sporting Goods as the lead mobile UX designer, and before that I was at Branding Brand, where I worked with brands such as Ralph Lauren, Sephora, Costco, and American Eagle.
